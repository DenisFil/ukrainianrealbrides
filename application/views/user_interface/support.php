If you are going to marry a woman, you might want to learn how to look beyond those. Of course, there are limits. If you are 40 and are looking for an 18-year-old bride, this might be a bit of a stretch, but 22-25 years old is ok. Remember that every person has their own standards. Some women don't mind a significant age difference, while others do. They usually indicate their age preference in their profiles.</p>
